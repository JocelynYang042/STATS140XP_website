This project aims to identify potential combination therapies for neurodegenerative diseases by studying gene-level interactions.\nLink to Poster: https://qcb.ucla.edu/wp-content/uploads/sites/14/2024/08/Yang_BIG_updated.pdf\n\n\nProject 2: Comparison of Mediation Testing Models in Two-Condition Pretest-Posttest Design\nTwo-condition pre-posttest designs are commonly used in clinical psychology studies to assess treatment effects across different time points. Mediation analysis is crucial in these designs for testing the intermediary role of a third variable in the causal relationship between treatment conditions and outcomes. Despite their importance, comprehensive comparisons among mediation models are limited. This study addresses this gap by evaluating the effectiveness of five mediation models.\nLink to Presentation: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sWXMBj8JiU8https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sWXMBj8JiU8"
